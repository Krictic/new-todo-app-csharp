# Terminal Todo App

## Introduction

TerminalTodoApp is a console-based Todo-list application developed for the purpose of learning C#. It is primarily a
demonstration of various Object-oriented Programming (OOP) principles and .NET software architecture concepts. This
application is an exciting journey of uncovering different layers of.NET and C# ecosystems - from the fundamental syntax
to advanced topics like file handling with Json, Encapsulation, SOLID principles and so on.

The application is mostly operational, offering a set of features for manipulating Todo objects such as creating,
updating, loading, and saving Todos. However, as a project with learning at its core, it is always under development.
Each line of code crafted here is seen as an opportunity to explore and experiment with different programming constructs
and concepts.

## Application Overview

The TerminalTodoApp begins by verifying the existence of the Json data on start-up. Once you're through the setup, you
would be greeted with a Main Menu which offers the following options:

- Create New Todo
- Remove Todo From TodoList
- Update Todo Name
- Update Todo Status
- Save Todo Data
- Load Todo Data
- Clear Todo Data
- Display Todo List
- Exit

These operations are self-explanatory and provide a seamless experience for managing your Todo-list. Each Todo item in
your Todo-list contains just enough details required like a name, id, and completion status.

## Future Development

As part of the future to-do list, here are a few items that could further improve the application:

- **Unit Test Coverage**: As a learning aid, incorporating unit testing will provide insight into the .NET testing
  ecosystem.
- **Input Validation**: More robust input validation could be added for a smoother user experience.
- **Logging Module**: Logs for successful and unsuccessful operations could be beneficial for both users and developers.
- **Database Integration**: Instead of Json data for persistence, a database could be used.
- **Task Prioritization (Done)**: An extension to existing todo model where we could prioritize tasks into categories
  like urgent/important/not urgent etc.
- **Todo Categories**: Categorize todos based on the defined genres (like Personal, Work & Miscellaneous).
- **Searching Todos**: Functionality to search todos based on name or id.

We're always open to feedback and contributions. Feel free to fork the project and submit a pull request if you fancy
adding new features to the TerminalTodoApp. Every bit of help is appreciated!

Remember, this is a learning project. The sky's the limit!
